# Modern, Dynamic and Interactive *Blogging Site* web application

This is one of my earlier web based projects. This is a dynamic *blog* application which is interactive and has some key features and Components.

#  The Technologies and Components used:

* Backend Technology: *Django* is used as the backend tool to handle server-side logic, data storage, and the overall structure of the application.

* Database: The project initially uses the default database provided by *Django*, which is *SQLite3*. However, there are plans to migrate to *PostgreSQL* in the future to ensure production-standard database management.

* Admin Site: Django's built-in admin site is utilized for managing models (such as users, posts and comments), and permissions. The admin site provides an easy-to-use interface for performing administrative tasks, including content management and can be customized to fit the specific requirements of our blogging site.

* Django Template Language: The site's front-end structure and layout are implemented using Django Template Language. This template language allows you to define HTML templates and include dynamic data using variables, loops, conditionals, and template tags.

* React Integration: *React* will be integrated soon for building the UI. React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. By integrating React with Django, we can create interactive and dynamic components on the client-side, enhancing the user experience of the blogging site.

Overall, this blogging site application combines the power of Django's backend capabilities, including its ORM, admin site, and template language, with the potential for a modern and interactive user interface through the future integration of React
